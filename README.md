## Features

- **Real-Time Email Monitoring:**  
  Uses Gmail API with OAuth 2.0 to fetch emails automatically.
  
- **Multi-Agent Analysis:**  
  - *Email Scanner:* Extracts email content and metadata.  
  - *NLP Analyzer:* Performs natural language analysis to detect urgent language, manipulation, and phishing signals.  
  - *Link Checker:* Extracts and evaluates hyperlinks, optionally testing them in a secure sandbox.  
  - *Report Generator:* Synthesizes analysis results into a comprehensive risk report.
  
- **Voice Command Interface:**  
  Control DeepFender with voice commands using speech-to-text (Whisper) and text-to-speech (pyttsx3).

- **Long-Term Memory & Adaptive Learning:**  
  Uses vector memory (FAISS/Chroma) to store historical analysis data for improved threat detection over time.

- **Cloud Integration:**  
  Stores analysis results in AWS DynamoDB/S3 and leverages AWS Bedrock (e.g., with Mistral) for LLM-based analysis.

- **User-Friendly Dashboard:**  
  (Optional) Visualize alerts, threat levels, and trends via a Streamlit/Gradio dashboard.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/deepfender.git
cd deepfender

 Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

python -m venv .venv```

# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

    Note: If you encounter issues installing pyaudio, consider using pipwin on Windows.

4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file at the project root with your configuration:

# Gmail API credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_google_refresh_token

# AWS Credentials
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION_NAME=eu-west-3
DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=deepfender-emails

# LLM & Model configuration
MODEL=mistral/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0:1

# Sandbox API (for link testing)
SANDBOX_API_KEY=your_sandbox_api_key

    Important: Add .env to your .gitignore to protect your credentials.

Usage
Launching Email Monitoring

Start the Gmail trigger to monitor your inbox:

python trigger_gmail.py

This script authenticates with Gmail, retrieves new emails, extracts headers, links, attachments, and passes data to the multi-agent workflow.
Running the Main Workflow

Execute the main graph that orchestrates agent processing:

python main.py

This flow processes an email through the following steps:

    Email Scanning: Extract content and metadata.

    NLP Analysis: Analyze tone, urgency, and phishing signals.

    Link Analysis: Extract and assess hyperlinks.

    Report Generation: Compile results into a final risk report.

(Optional) Running the Dashboard

If a dashboard is implemented, launch it with:

streamlit run ui/dashboard.py
